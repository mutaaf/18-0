# 18-0 on Watch

A Chrome extension that puts a playable 18-0 card into a row on
[espn.com/watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/), to show what the game looks like
sitting where people already are.

<br>

## Load it

Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** on → **Load unpacked** →
choose this folder. Then open `espn.com/watch`.

It is loaded unpacked on purpose and is not published. See
[What this is, and is not](#what-this-is-and-is-not).

<br>

## Use it

The toolbar button has three controls.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Show the card** | Off leaves the page completely untouched. |
| **Match the Watch UI** | On, the card takes the same box, corner and caption block as its neighbours, so it sits *in* the row. Off, it announces itself. |
| **Row** | Which row to sit in. Pick from the list, or press **Pick a row on the page** and click one. |

Clicking the card opens the game over the page. Escape closes it.

<br>

## How it finds a row

Structurally, not by selector. The Watch page is a React app with generated
class names, so anything matching `.WatchShelf__row` works until the next deploy
and then fails silently — the card never appears and there is nothing to debug.

What does not change is the *shape* of a carousel: a container whose children are
several boxes of near-identical width sharing a top edge. That is what
`findRows()` looks for, and it is why the picker names rows by their visible
heading rather than by a path.

Rows arrive after first paint and re-render on navigation, so a `MutationObserver`
re-places the card — debounced, and behind a cheap guard that does no work at all
while the card is still where it belongs. Re-scanning a page like this one on
every mutation is a page that janks.

<br>

## What it loads

`https://18-0.co/embed` — a play-only surface with no sign-in, no handle and no
account deletion, and the only path on the site that may be framed.

That split is a security decision rather than a design one. The obvious way to
get a game into a frame is to stop sending `X-Frame-Options`, and doing that
site-wide would put the account screen — including a button that deletes an
account and every season on it — inside a page whose owner controls where the
cursor lands. Clickjacking is a real attack against precisely that button. So
`vercel.json` scopes `frame-ancestors` to `/embed` and names the origins allowed
to hold it; everything else still refuses to be framed at all.

The frame reports which screen it is on — entry, play, result — with
`postMessage`, so the panel can size itself to a two-line card or a seven-row
roster. It is one-way and advisory, the listener checks the origin before
reading anything, and the payload is the name of a screen.

<br>

## What this is, and is not

**It is** a demo. It runs on the machine you load it on, it adds one card to a
page, and it changes nothing else on it. The panel that opens says who put it
there, in both looks, because something that opens a window over somebody's page
should say so.

**It is not** an integration, an endorsement, or anything to publish. Injecting
UI into a site you do not own is fine for showing an idea to your own team and is
a different question entirely once it is distributed — which is why this is
loaded unpacked rather than sitting in the Chrome Web Store, and why the manifest
asks for `espn.com/watch` and nothing wider.

18-0 is unaffiliated with, and not endorsed by, ESPN or any league or club.
